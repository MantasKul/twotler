# Welcome to Twotler

Project I'm using to learn Spring Boot, Spring Security, Angular, etc. by creating sort of Twitter clone (or as close as I'll get).

Current issue:
- Getting  StackOverflowError from acallin authenticate()

Currently main goals are:
- Create sign up and login (logout) functionallity
- Create front end part so one can use sign up and login properly
- Create ability to make a post
- Hash passwords
