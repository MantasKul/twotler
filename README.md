# Welcome to Twotler

Project I'm using to learn Spring Boot, Spring Security, Angular, etc. by creating sort of Twitter clone (at least using it as an example of what to implement as long as I'm learning).

Currently main goals are:
- Make home page, login/signup dialog windows nice/stylized
- Hash passwords
- Create ability to create posts (fronten and backend parts)
