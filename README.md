# Welcome to Twotler

Project I'm using to learn Spring Boot, Spring Security, Angular, etc. by creating sort of Twitter clone (at least using it as an example of what to implement as long as I'm learning).

# What needs to be done
- Make a simple design for home page, login/signup dialog windows and apply it
- Hash the passwords
- Remove "Forgot Password" API as it just sends the password to email, as the passwords will be hashed this might not be possible to do, instead change password should be used
- Implement change password in the front end
- Hide Logout/Signup buttons when logged in, hide logout button when not logged in
- Start working on ability to create posts (Start with simple text post and build on top of it)
